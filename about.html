        <h3>Origins and Breakthrough</h3>
        <p>
          Green Day was formed in 1987 in East Bay, California, by Billie Joe Armstrong and Mike Dirnt. Originally named
          Sweet Children, they adopted the name Green Day and quickly gained attention in the underground punk scene.

          In 1994, the release of their third album <em>Dookie</em> launched them into international fame, selling over
          10
          million copies. The album featured hits like “Basket Case” and “When I Come Around.”

          After a dip in popularity, Green Day returned in 2004 with <em>American Idiot</em>, a rock opera critiquing
